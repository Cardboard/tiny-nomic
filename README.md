# tiny-nomic: Nomic on Github

This repository represents a game of
[Nomic](http://legacy.earlham.edu/~peters/nomic.htm) where the bookkeeping of
the rules and the scores is done through Markdown flavored text files in a Github repository.

The repository is the single source of authority on the current state of the game (unless, of course, the rules change and that is no longer the case).
