The game shall consist of a series of rounds. Each round begins immediately
after the end of the turn of the last player in the previous round. A player is
said to be *in* a round if the player has a player file in the `players/`
directory when the round begins. The order of turns is determined by taking the
numeric part of the name of each file in the `players/` directory and assigning 
it to the player corresponding to the file. The player with the lowest number
goes first and play passes to each player in increasing numeric order of his or
her assigned number.

Turns may not be skipped or passed, and parts of turns may not be omitted. All
players begin with zero points, which should be reflected in their player files.
