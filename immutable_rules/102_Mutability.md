Initially rules in the 100's are immutable and rules in the 200's are mutable.
Rules subsequently enacted or transmuted (that is, changed from immutable to
mutable or *vice versa*) may be immutable or mutable regardless of their
numbers, and rules in the Initial Set may be transmuted regardless of their
numbers.

If the game is being played on Github, mutable rules must be stored in the mutable_rules/ directory and immutable rules must be stored in the immutable_rules/ directory. The directory in which a rule resides is the sole factor in determining its mutability.
