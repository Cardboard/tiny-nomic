Rule-changes that transmute immutable rules into mutable rules may be adopted
if and only if the vote is unanimous among the eligible voters. Transmutation
shall not be implied, but must be stated explicitly in a proposal to take
effect.

If the game is being played on Github, a simple file move to or from the immutable_rules/mutable_rules directories shall satisfy this rule.
